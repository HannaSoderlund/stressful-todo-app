# A Stressful Christmas Todo app
An exercise to practice using Node.js and MongoDB with the Controller-Services pattern and Express for routing.

## Get the API running:
- Make sure you have `node` installed on your machine
- Clone this repository
- Run npm install in the terminal from the root of the project
- Run node start.js in the terminal from the root of the project
- The API should now be running on `localhost:3000`

## Trying out the front end:
- After cloning the repo, run `index.html` on your local host. (eg `http://localhost:1234/projects/todoapp/stressful-todo-app/todofrontend/index.html`)
